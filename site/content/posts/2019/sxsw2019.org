* No Hard Feelings: Emotions at Work
"No Hard Feelings" book
Liz Fisslien, Mollie West Duffy
@lisandmollie

There are no scripts for common interactions at work

The circle of office life
"let's take this offline"
"let's talk about it in the meeting"

Effectively harnessing emotion
- Look for unwritten rules about how authentic to be within a formal
  setting
- Emotions are inevitable - learn how to deal with them

Emotional culture
- look for signs on the wall admonishing
- photos of home life
- signs of pride
- Interview question: "Tell me a story about something that would only
  happen here"

Belonging
- Diversity is having a seat at the table
- inclusion is having a voice
- belonging is having that voice be heard

Micro actions for belonging
- pronounce and spell names correctly
- once a month, grab coffee or lunch with someone new
- when someone joins a conversation, take a moment to bring them up to
  speed
- if you notice someone get cut off mid sentence, take a moment to
  jump in and ask them to continue sharing their thoughts.

What can organizations do?

Transition moments. On-boarding.
- begin on-boarding before start date
- assign a culture buddy
- conduct an "enterview" Have everyone who interviewed them write
  down - what they were impressed about, the key skills, what they
  most want to know about them. Put these on post-it notes on the new
  hire's desk
- Have managers share ups and downs

Meetings and teams
- appoint a meeting monitor (looking at participation, engagement)
- who needed to be in the room
- send out an agenda ahead of the meeting
- host a bad ideas brainstorm (15 minutes)
- try opt-in "pair calls" 1 hour to only talk about not work


Watch out for what you're sacrificing for your job
Protecting your health and friendships - this helps your effectiveness
You life must be sustainable
"I'll be happy when I get _____" - opposite is true being happy gets
you rewarded

Avoiding burnout
- see every experience as a learning opportunity
- find the moments during the day that bring you join
- try to shift your role to do more of those joyful things
- freedom and autonomy bring happiness
- finding your own way to effective solutions to business problems
- as a manager - hold a weekly office hours for any conversations

Emotions in decision making
- there's a science to listening to your gut
- not all feelings are useful
- your envy can reveal what you truly value

Ask question to determine others real intent
Walk away when needed

* Grit
@AnnRHiatt

Amazon, Google
Redmond
She was XO to Jeff Bezos

12 years at Google
XO to Eric Schmidt

Do more with less. Balance.
Where you spend your time and where your values are.

See Grit TED Talk by Angela Lee
may be inverse to intelligence
marathonning

This was a key to success for her.
Taught her to value a learning mindset versus a performance mindset

"I heard you're really good under pressure"

Three steps you can take

*** Find your passion and purpose
Internal-facing passion
- This is what gives a spring to your step
- Changes sometimes
Externally-facing purpose
- longer-term

*** Managing through change
- monitor for frustration and burn out
- you
- your team
- your support network

She made a spreadsheet
Column A her tasks and responsibilities
Column B was the things she really like to do
Column C how to springboard from those to ideal future

Bring your teams along with you
Communicate the what and the why
- cycling analogy - when you know the finish line you can work harder

Your friend network
- communicate your goals with them

*** Institutionalizing grit
- how do you organize your team to do this
- incentivize this
- OKR (John Dorr book) (moon shots - aim high - you won't make all of them)
- trust
- authenticity, open discussion
- safe to fail
- hire people who aim higher
- team aimed at the same star

*** Reinvention
- Book: Art and Fear. Learning mind set did better.
- avoid perfectionist paralysis.
- put in the reps. wake up, kick ass, repeat.
- dedicate time to analyze your failures (and your big successes)
- Jeff would lock himself in a hotel room for a week with no stimulus
  and write in a notebook.
- being comfortable with uncomfortable. she sold everything and moved
  to Spain.
- Erik Schmidt: "when possible, say yes" Expand your circle of
  influence - add experts - and learn.

*** Pivoting
- habits to be made
- Pareto principle (apply this to your TODO list)
- Eat that frog on the 20%
- be thoughtful
- changing your priorities may upset some people. focus on what is
  truly important and delegate or drop the rest.

Biggest contributor to happiness at work is a feeling of control.
Time box your calendar. Take those 20% tasks and lock them into your
calendar for a couple hours. Set a hard start and stop.

Delegate more. Focus on the biggest deliverable. Help your direct
reports do this also.

Read "Time for Happiness" - HBR

Reward your employees with time if you can.
There's nothing to celebrate in useless toil.

Productivity isn't a virtue. Creativity, Generosity.

* Engineering a team for high growth
Panelists: Yahoo, StitchFix, Slack, WeWork

First, must build trust

How do you prepare for change?
- must constantly adapt your role as needed
- at the beginning of growth, hire generalists
- as you scale, hire more specialists
- find leaders with domain experience
- expect difficulty
- hire people that can handle that amount of change

If you're doing the same thing you did last year, you're not being
successful

face to face travel is critical to building emotional trust and
effective relationships - builds team capability.

remote-friendly culture - Dave Coupland talked about how to be a good
remote engineer. Assume positive intent. Ask questions.

Maintaining culture as you scale
- knowing your values
- have relevant questions and interview for them
- create reward systems for those values
- evolve as you grow
- reward, remind, incentivize
- brainstorm: what are some of the behaviors that make us successful,
  what behaviors get you promoted here? Then see if these answers
  match your values.
- values are the living practices of the leaders and what they uphold
- what's your company OS? values, principles, leadership practices
- stitchfix: bring, kind, oriented
- engineering values: product-centric, bias for action, simple
  solution, quick ship.
- Product interview for every engineer - collaborate with
  non-technical person to solve a business problem. finds strong
  communicators.

- finding people who have built something from the ground up
- passionate about solving workplace issues

Attracting and retaining talent
- takes time - build interest by speaking at conferences
- active blog presence to build tech brand
- open to hire remote
- "wework is a technology company"
- have a compelling vision and mission
- people join companies for mission (initially) brand is key
- people join ultimately for people
- how does your company become known for a certain type of technology?
- you must be able to sell and evangelize that vision for the future
- we fall in love with people (not companies)
- expose applicants to a wide variety of folks

How do you sell employees on a longer-term vision (and with respect to
it may not be fully defined or may be confidential)
- how do you communicate in powerful way?
- write a lot
- find the motivations of the candidate and explain the overlap
- your job as manager is painting the big picture
- Share OKRs

Status
- what is the problem you're trying to solve?
- awareness
- socialization
- what are the early warning signs of when something is not going to
  scale?

What are your top use cases for your 2020 vision?
Building out a road map

Have a process defined where new people can make their first commit on
the first day. First feature in first month. New architects take
longer. Invest in the tools you need to do this.

think about culture *add*, instead of culture *fit*

Recruiting is a long game. Don't compromise your values.

Have a list of people that you regularly get coffee.

OKRs - you must be able to measure what you value. you can let the
teams define how they measure.

* Startups, Partnerships, Trends and Google

What offerings could help us with our Docs Platform?

Google, Anchor (podcasting, just bought by Spotify), Overtime (sports)

Most startups need a host


GFS - Google for Startups

Start on Android
LJ Erwin
lje@google.com

Google Sand Hill program
After series A, through VC referral

- treat partnerships like mature companies treat hiring.
- what can you do or not do with a particular partner
- will the users really come from a product integration?
- time as most valuable product
- partnering with other startups where incentives align
- unsplash
- look for companies thinking of making integration easy (APIs)
- how adventurous are they? risk taking ability. be careful how much
  time you invest in large/low-risk tolerance companies.

watch out for prioritizing short-term growth
don't give away/lend too much value to big partners - damages your
leverage

Google is an AI-first company
fintech (conference this week), health care, social impact verticals

stay relentlessly focused on your mission. achieving product-market
fit and scale as rapidly as possible.

reap what you sow

GH

- speed of delivery
- CD
- no waterfall planning
- it's about principles, not tools
- removing walls
- aligning incentives
- if you write code, you're on call
- leveraging successful os methodology in your org
- enterprise open source
- speed with accuracy
- most important metrics: measure it then leverage it. uptime,
  releases per day, sales, bad choice of metrics can tell you the
  wrong things, cycle time, regressions
- continuous improvement, SRE, blameless postmortems, extract
  learnings, psychological safety, five whys to find root cause

What excites you about 2019?
- chaos engineering (Netflix) building resilience
- cloud is a race to the bottom
- hybrid is the next phase
- you must keep investing in tooling
- let teams decide where to invest
- increase reliability and decrease tech debt
- and be able to make a business case for this
- cost of risk

* The Alchemy and Science of Metrics
Presenter from Indeed.com

how do you know if your ideas work? use big data.
data is useless - it can only give you answers

Alchemy
- incomplete
- inflexible
- inexplicable

creating a science of metrics
quality and quantity
define a holistic system
manipulate the system to achieve your goal

engagement = clicks

searches
page views
monthly unique visitors
page count
DAU daily active users

turn data into information

there is one right metric for everyone: lifetime value
total product benefit generated over all time
this could take a lifetime to measure

meta-metrics
- sensitivity: how quickly you can influence and move a metric
- correlation: frequency of agreement with lifetime value
- plot sensitivity vs correlation

Pareto principle applied to efficiency - when you can't improve one
thing without making something else work.
- reward vs. risk
- healthy vs. delicious

"efficient frontier" between sensitivity and correlation as relates to
lifetime value.

map standard product funnel to metrics
e.g. search tap apply interview offer

problem to work to output to input to work to output and so on

where to validate changes? at decision points
favor outcomes when late in the funnel

(session is being recorded)

* Building an In-House Design Powerhouse
Building an In-House Design Powerhouse
Stephen Gates, Head of Design Transformation at InVision

creating change
- avoid the thought trap. think beyond the project in front of you.
  not about being right (because then someone else is wrong)
- don't rationalize mediocracy
- align the source of truth for your work to data, research, and real
  consumers
- start thinking about the words you use
- take the light bulbs out of your deck inspiration vs creativity
- invision design leadership forum
- invision design exchange
- a cover band never changed the world

You create change through a lot of little things that add up to
something big.

"This might get me fired" Gregory Larkin.

The transformation will not be approved.

Teach, partner, lead the change to truly break through.

* Product design in the age of AI
VP Product at Shutterstock

opportunity analysis
opportunity compass
capturing intent
feedback must be validated against user experience and IA
learn and release
define, synthesize, prepare
become a data enthusiast (hire a data scientist)

* A New Space Age: Disrupting Investment & Innovation
What's next?
- speed
- time
- relativity
- black holes
- holographic principle (each particle contains all universal information)
- quantum behavior
- consciousness has no definition of time

Cause and effect
- breaking the relativity model
- inter-dimensional travel
- we don't know what we're looking for, if we don't have a common
  ancestor
- the renaissance focus on transient qualities e.g. beauty
- we are the transient ones
- getting beyond transience to be able to travel through space and
  time
- Newtonian physics then relativity (100 years)
- must beat the odds / break the system to travel

The impossible is probable
- Plato's allegory of the cave
- we're at a tipping point in history
- intergalactic travel in her lifetime
- redefining what it means to be human
- the definition of consciousness
